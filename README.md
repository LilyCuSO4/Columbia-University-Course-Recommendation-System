# Columbia Course Recommendation System

## Project Overview
The full-stack project aims to provide a course recommendation system to students of Columbia University based on their previous course selection, track interests and program checklist. The system could help students to schedule their courses more efficiently by solving any
time conflicts problems and providing rates of professors and a message board for them to
communicate.
